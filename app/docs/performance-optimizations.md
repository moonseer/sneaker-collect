# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Sneaker Collect Plus application to ensure fast loading times, smooth user experience, and efficient resource usage.

## Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

### Implementation

We've implemented code splitting and lazy loading using React's `Suspense` and `lazy` APIs to reduce the initial bundle size and improve page load times.

- **Lazy-loaded Components**: Major page components are lazy-loaded, meaning they're only downloaded when needed.
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Each lazy-loaded component is wrapped in a Suspense boundary with a fallback loading state.
- **Custom Loading States**: We've created tailored loading states for each page type to provide a smooth user experience during loading.

### Files

- `src/lib/lazy-load.tsx`: Contains the lazy loading utilities and loading components.
- `src/app/routes.tsx`: Defines the application routes with lazy-loaded components.

### Usage

```tsx
// Example of lazy loading a component
import { DashboardPage } from "@/lib/lazy-load";

// The component will be loaded only when rendered
<DashboardPage />
```

## Caching Layer

### Implementation

We've implemented a caching layer to reduce redundant database queries and API calls, improving response times and reducing server load.

- **In-memory Cache**: A simple but effective in-memory cache with TTL (Time To Live) support.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic and manual cache invalidation to ensure data freshness.
- **Function Caching**: Higher-order function to cache the results of async functions.

### Files

- `src/lib/cache.ts`: Contains the cache implementation and utilities.
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`: Uses the cache for database operations.

### Usage

```tsx
// Example of caching a database query
export const getSneakers = cachedQuery(
  async (userId: string, isWishlist = false) => {
    // Database query implementation
  },
  (userId: string, isWishlist = false) => 
    `${isWishlist ? CACHE_KEYS.WISHLIST : CACHE_KEYS.SNEAKERS}${userId}`,
  { ttl: 5 * 60 * 1000 } // 5 minutes cache
);
```

## Database Query Optimization

### Implementation

We've optimized database queries to reduce the number of requests and improve response times.

- **Batch Loading**: Implemented a DataLoader-like utility to batch and deduplicate database queries.
- **Query Optimization**: Optimized database queries to fetch only the required data.
- **Caching**: Combined with the caching layer to further reduce database load.

### Files

- `src/lib/batch-loader.ts`: Contains the batch loading implementation.
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`: Uses the batch loader for database operations.

### Usage

```tsx
// Example of batch loading
const sneakerDetailLoader = createBatchLoader({
  batchLoadFn: async (ids: readonly string[]) => {
    // Batch database query implementation
  },
  cacheKeyFn: (id: string) => `${CACHE_KEYS.SNEAKER_DETAIL}${id}`,
  maxBatchSize: 20,
  batchWaitMs: 50,
});

// Usage
export async function getSneakerById(id: string) {
  return sneakerDetailLoader.load(id);
}
```

## Bundle Size Optimization

### Implementation

We've optimized the bundle size to reduce download times and improve initial page load performance.

- **Webpack Configuration**: Customized webpack configuration to optimize chunk splitting.
- **Bundle Analysis**: Added bundle analyzer to identify and reduce large dependencies.
- **Tree Shaking**: Ensured proper tree shaking to eliminate unused code.
- **Code Splitting**: Combined with code splitting to further reduce bundle sizes.

### Files

- `next.config.js`: Contains the webpack configuration for bundle optimization.
- `package.json`: Contains scripts for bundle analysis.

### Usage

```bash
# Analyze the bundle size
npm run analyze

# Analyze only the server bundle
npm run analyze:server

# Analyze only the browser bundle
npm run analyze:browser
```

## Image Optimization

### Implementation

We've implemented comprehensive image optimization to improve loading times and reduce bandwidth usage.

- **Next.js Image Optimization**: Leveraging Next.js's built-in image optimization.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded only when they enter the viewport.
- **Responsive Images**: Images are served at the appropriate size for the device.
- **Progressive Loading**: Low-quality placeholders are shown while the full image loads.
- **Error Handling**: Fallback images are shown when an image fails to load.

### Files

- `src/components/ui/optimized-image.tsx`: Contains the optimized image components.
- `src/components/ui/placeholder-image.tsx`: Contains the placeholder image component.
- `src/components/ui/image-gallery.tsx`: Contains the image gallery components.

### Usage

```tsx
// Example of using the optimized image component
<OptimizedImage
  src="/path/to/image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width={600}
  height={400}
  aspectRatio="landscape"
  rounded="md"
  objectFit="cover"
/>
```

## Performance Monitoring

To ensure continued performance, we recommend:

1. **Regular Bundle Analysis**: Run `npm run analyze` regularly to identify and address bundle size increases.
2. **Performance Testing**: Use tools like Lighthouse to measure and monitor performance.
3. **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze user feedback on performance issues.
4. **Server Monitoring**: Monitor server response times and resource usage.

## Future Optimizations

Potential future optimizations include:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implement SSR for critical pages to improve initial load time.
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render static pages where possible.
3. **Service Worker**: Implement a service worker for offline support and caching.
4. **HTTP/2**: Ensure the server supports HTTP/2 for more efficient resource loading.
5. **CDN Integration**: Use a CDN for static assets to reduce latency.
